# Ideas
## Unimplemented
* separate economy and combat turns
* select tiles from a list instead of on map
* map trading
* generic alliance (no subtypes like in Civ 6)
* Use hex grid
* Make rally point with actions when you build the units (i.e. place a city when you start settler production)
* lenses
* turning policies on or off costs culture
* buying great people costs culture? faith?
* buying borders costs culture
  * buying borders costs more culture the further away the tile is from your borders
  * encircling tiles converts them to your borders
* hurry production with gold
* think about anit snowballing mechanics, that don't increase production cost with more cities
* background progress towards techs owned by other nations
  * Amount increases the longer another nation has a tech
* floating tooltips like CK3
* cities don't have a religion but pops do
  * pops can convert to a religion
  * faith output is proportional to pops following the religion
  * can build faith buildings in other players' cities
* use faith to reserve wonders, have to reserve them before you can build them
