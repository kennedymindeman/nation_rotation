# Ideas
## Unimplemented
* separate economy and combat turns
* select tiles from a list instead of on map
* map trading
* generic alliance (no subtypes like in Civ 6)
* Use hex grid
* Make rally point with actions when you build the units (i.e. place a city when you start settler production)
* lenses
